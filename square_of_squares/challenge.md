## a Square of Squares

You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Write a function called `isSquare` that takes a number as an argument. Make it so the function determines if the number passed in is a [square number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number), and return true if it is, false if it isn't 

**Example Output:** 

```javascript
isSquare(-1) // returns false
isSquare(0) // returns true
isSquare(3) // returns false
isSquare(4) // returns true
isSquare(25) // returns true  
isSquare(26) // returns false
```

(BONUS: Can you write the solution in one line?)
