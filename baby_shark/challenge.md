## Baby Shark

You've heard of Fizz Buzz, but now... let's Baby Shark! 

Write a function called `babyShark` that takes a number as an argument. Console log as many lines as the number passed in. 
  - For every odd numbered line, have it print `Baby shark`
  - For every even numbered line, have it print `doo doo do doo do do`  

**Example Output:** 

```js
babyShark(7) 

// should return...
// Baby shark
// doo doo do doo do do 
// Baby shark
// doo doo do doo do do 
// Baby shark
// doo doo do doo do do 
// Baby shark
```
